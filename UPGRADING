Upgrading from 3.05 or earlier

3.06 added a new Scrip Action that will need to be added
to your database.  You can do this with the rt-setup-database
tool:

  /opt/rt3/sbin/rt-setup-database --action insert --datadir etc/upgrade/3.06/

This will prompt for your rt database password and then add a new
scrip action that you can use to add Text::Template preprocessing to 
your ECFV templates.
