NAME
    RT::Extension::ExtractCustomFieldValues - extract CF values from email
    headers or body

DESCRIPTION
    ExtractCustomFieldValues is based on a scrip action
    "ExtractCustomFieldValues", which can be used to scan incoming emails to
    set values of custom fields.

INSTALLATION
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install
        make initdb # first time only

    When using this extension with RT 3.8, you will need to add extension to
    the Plugins configuration:

        Set( @Plugins, qw(... RT::Extension::ExtractCustomFieldValues) );

USAGE
    To use the ScripAction, create a Template and a Scrip in RT. Your new
    Scrip should use a ScripAction of 'Extract Custom Field Values'. The
    Template consists of the lines which control the scanner. All
    non-comment lines are of the following format:

        <cf-name>|<Headername>|<MatchString>|<Postcmd>|<Options>

    where:

    <cf-name> - the name of a custom field (must be created in RT) If this
    field is blank, the match will be run and Postcmd will be executed, but
    no custom field will be updated. Use this if you need to execute other
    RT code based on your match.
    <Headername> - either a Name of an email header, "body" to scan the body
    of the email or "headers" to search all of the headers.
    <MatchString> - a regular expression to find a match in the header or
    body if the MatchString matches a comma separated list and the CF is a
    multi value CF then each item in the list is added as a separate value.
    <Postcmd> - a perl code to be evaluated on $value, where $value is
    either $1 or full match text from the match performed with <MatchString>
    <Options> - a string of letters which may control some aspects. Possible
    options include:

        'q' - (quiet) Don't record a transaction when adding the custom
        field value
        '*' - (wildcard) The MatchString regex should contain _two_
        capturing groups, the first of which is the CF name, the second of
        which is the value. If this option is given, the <cf-name> field is
        ignored.

  Separator
    You can change the separator string (initially "\|") during the template
    with:

        Separator=<anyregexp>

    Changing the separator may be necessary, if you want to use a "|" in one
    of the patterns in the controlling lines.

  Example and further reading
    An example template with some further examples is installed during "make
    install" or "make insert-template". See the CustomFieldScannerExample
    template for examples and further documentation.
